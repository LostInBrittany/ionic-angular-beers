# Ionic Angular Beers


## An Ionic port of [Angular Beers](https://github.com/LostInBrittany/angular-beers) 

*A work-in-progress tutorial for Ionic based on my [Angular Beers](https://github.com/LostInBrittany/angular-beers) tutorial for AngularJS*

I have built this [Ionic Angular Beers](https://github.com/LostInBrittany/ionic-angular-beers) tutorial as a quick entry point to [Ionic](/http://ionicframework.com/), based on  [Angular Beers](https://github.com/LostInBrittany/angular-beers), an [AngularJS](http://angular.io) tutorial I've written.


## What are the objectives of this tutorial

By following this tutorial you will learn to build an Ionic application, and to port an AngularJS application to Ionic.
This tutorial supposes you have a basic knowledge of AngularJS and that you have already done the Angular Beers tutorial.


## What do I need to use this tutorial

Besides a web browser and a text-editor (we suggest the excellent [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)), you need:


+ [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
+ [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
+ [Ionic](/http://ionicframework.com/)

In order to test your mobile application you will also need either [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and/or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).


## How is the tutorial organized

As many computers used for the course haven't Git, we have structurated the project to allow a Git-less use. The `app` directory is the sources directory of the project, the working version of the code. The tutorial is divided in steps, each one in its own directory:

1. [Empty application](./step-01/)
